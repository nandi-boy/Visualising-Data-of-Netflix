# üìä Netflix Data Visualization

## üìå Project Overview:

> This mini-project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of Netflix‚Äôs dataset. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we uncover patterns, insights, and trends related to Netflix shows and movies.

The project provides an interactive and visual approach to understand:

* Distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows

* Content release trends over the years

* Genre/category analysis

* Country-wise contribution to Netflix content

* Ratings distribution

## üìÇ Dataset:

* Dataset: Netflix dataset (CSV)

* Contains details such as:

  * `show_id` ‚Äì Unique ID for each show/movie

  * `type` ‚Äì Movie / TV Show

  * `title` ‚Äì Name of the show/movie

  * `director`, `cast` ‚Äì Key contributors

  * `country` ‚Äì Country of production

  * `release_year` ‚Äì Release year

  * `rating` ‚Äì Age category rating

    
## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries:

  * The following Python libraries were used:

    * Pandas ‚Üí Data cleaning & manipulation

    * Matplotlib ‚Üí Static visualizations (line charts, scatter plots, bar plots)
      
 ## Install required packages:
      pip install matplotlib
      pip install jupyter
      pip install pandas

## üìà Visualizations & Insights:

* Some of the visualizations in this project include:

    * ‚úÖ Count of Movies vs. TV Shows

    * ‚úÖ Trend of content release by year

    * ‚úÖ Top contributing countries in Netflix‚Äôs library

    * ‚úÖ Ratings distribution (TV-MA, PG, R, etc.)

> Each visualization helps answer questions about what kind of content Netflix provides, when it expanded, and which countries dominate its library.
